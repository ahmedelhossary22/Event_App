# Event_App
The Event App is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to create, manage, and explore events easily.
Itâ€™s designed with Firebase as the backend for authentication and real-time data management.
Each user can sign up or log in (with email/password), and their events are stored securely in Firestore â€” meaning every user has their own personalized list of events.

 How It Works

User signs up â†’ Firebase creates a new account

Firestore automatically starts empty for that new user

User adds events â†’ Events are stored under Firestoreâ€™s events_table

When logging in again, the app retrieves that userâ€™s saved events only
